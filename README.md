## Hi there!
My name's Ian and I'm a May 2025 new graduate from the University of Michigan, where I studied Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I'm currently looking for full-time employment to further develop my skills with applied programming for complex and challenging projects that also use my hardware and electrical engineering experience.

## ðŸ”§ Skills & Interests

- **Programming Languages**: Python, C/C++, and MATLAB
- **Interests**: Digital Signal Processing, Embedded Systems, Vehicle and Autonomous Systems, Computers, 3D Printing
- **Preferred Development Environment**: MacOS/Linux, Visual Studio Code

## ðŸš€ Projects

### Real-Time Ultrasonic Sensor Defense
- **Description**: Senior design class project creating and recognizing attack signals on ultrasonic sensors.
- **Objective**: Demonstrating real-time signal processing skills and highlighting the risks of single-sensor autonomous systems. We were able to recognize attacks but not defend against them fully, indicating that sensors like this need redundancy to make them safer.

### Door-Mounted Occupancy Tracking System
- **Description**: Time-of-Flight Sensor with ESP32 and I2C in Arduino, using blob detection to catch complex cases of door movement.
- **Objective**: Final project for my upper-level system design class. We had to track movement over several simple and edge cases by designing a full system from software to mounting and PCB.

### Image Denoising with Non-Uniform Noise (Private - active research project)
- **Description**: Modified grayscale K-SVD algorithm for indpendent study, using OMP and Rank-1 SVD. Results are positive with uniform noise but mixed with non-uniform noise.
- **Possible Future Improvements**: Creating a library for easy use, developing better debugging stats for tuning parameters, and boosting performance with non-uniform noise.
